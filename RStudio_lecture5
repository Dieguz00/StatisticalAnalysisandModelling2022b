### Matrixes

## Creating a matrix

# matrixes are two-dimensional, while vectors are one-dimensional
# create a vector
vec1 <- 1:9
# create a matrix, specifying the number of rows; remember that the first argument within parenthesis is the vector, the second is the number of rows:
m <- matrix(vec1, nrow=3)
# take a look at your first matrix =):
m
# remember that first come the rows, second come the columns; that's the reason behind the names of the rows and columns of a raw matrix
# let's check the class:
class(m)
# and also the type:
typeof(m)

# let's create another matrix, this time specifying columns:
m <- matrix(LETTERS[1:9], ncol=3)
m
