### Matrixes

## Creating a matrix

# matrixes are two-dimensional, while vectors are one-dimensional
# create a vector
vec1 <- 1:9
# create a matrix, specifying the number of rows; remember that the first argument within parenthesis is the vector, the second is the number of rows:
m <- matrix(vec1, nrow=3)
# take a look at your first matrix =):
m
# remember that first come the rows, second come the columns; that's the reason behind the names of the rows and columns of a raw matrix
# let's check the class:
class(m)
# and also the type:
typeof(m)

# let's create another matrix, this time specifying columns:
m <- matrix(LETTERS[1:9], ncol=3)
m


## Modifying a matrix

# considering the last matrix created, let's traspone it:
t(m)
# or also, by "recreating" the matrix:
m <- matrix(data=LETTERS[1:9], ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
m


## Creating a matrix (pt.2)

# another way to create matrixes is to bind vectors, so create some of them:
first_row <- 1:5
second_row <- 11:15
third_row <- 101:105
# and the bind them together in a matrix:
rbind(first_row, second_row, third_row)

# on the other hand, we can also bind them in columns, rather than in rows:
first_col <- 1:5
second_col <- 11:15
third_col <- 101:105
cbind(first_col, second_col, third_col)


## Analyzing a matrix

# we can extract some info about our matrix:
length(m)
nrow(m)
ncol(m)
# we can also take a look at the number of raws and columns together, in this respective order:
dim(m)


## Modifying a matrix (pt.2)

# we can see and modify (add) the names of rows and columns:
rownames(m)
rownames(m) <- c("r1", "r2", "r3")
m
colnames(m) <- c("c1", "c2", "c3")
m

# or we can eliminate names thanks to the NULL vector (a vector of lenght 0, it doesn't exist):
rownames(m) <- NULL
m


## Analyzing a matrix (pt.2)

# to extract a specific value, specify the row and the column, respectively in this order:
m[1, 1]
m[2,1]
m[2,3]
# or you can also extract just a whole row or a whole column:
m[1, ]
m[, 2]
# or also more than one raw or more than one column:
m[, 2:3]
m[, c(1,3)]
m[2:3, -2]
# in this last case, "-2" stands for "every column except the second one
# you can also use names instead of numbers, even in the same "request":
m["r1", ]
m["r1", c(1,3)]
