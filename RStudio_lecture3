Today we're going to deal with data structure ^_^

### Simple logical expressions
## relational operators
# we can make R evaluate some expressions, receiving outcomes "TRUE" or "FALSE":
1 < 2
2 > 3
# in the case of "bigger/smaller than or equal", the "=" goes always after the ">" or "<":
2 <= 3
2 >= 2
# in the case of "equal to", we need two "=":
4 == 4
# this due to the fact that just one "=" operates the same function as "<-":
a = 4
a <- 4
# if we want to test if two objects are different:
2 != 5
# example with outcome "TRUE"
a <- 3
b <- 2
a < b
# if we want to make R consider the alphabetical order, we can use brackets:
"a" < "b"
# let's test the identity of a variable:
a <- "tree"
a == "tree"
a != "tree"

## logical operators
# let's evaluate the intersection of two logical expression, so if both of them are TRUE; this is called the "And" operator:
a <- 1
b <- 3
a < 3 && b < 4
a > 3 && b < 4
# the "or" operator, instead:
a > 3 || b < 4
# to negate a logical value, that is, to obtain the opposite logical value:
!FALSE
!(a > 3 || b < 4)

## priorities
# multiplications have the priority over sums and subtractions:
1 + 2 * 3
# exponentiations have the priority even over multiplications and divisions:
1 + 2 * 3 ** 2
# everything that is between parenthesis has the priority over everything else:
(1 + 2) * 3
# relational operators have lower priorities than numerical operators:
(1 + 2) * 3 < a
# logical operators have lower priorities than relational operators:
(1 + 2) * 3 < a || b > 2 ** 3 / 2
# let's try to put a "negation" operator for the expression:
(1 + 2) * 3 < a || !(b > 2 ** 3 / 2)
