Today we're going to deal with data structure ^_^

### Simple logical expressions
# we can make R evaluate some expressions, receiving outcomes "TRUE" or "FALSE":
1 < 2
2 > 3
# in the case of "bigger/smaller than or equal", the "=" goes always after the ">" or "<":
2 <= 3
2 >= 2
# in the case of "equal to", we need two "=":
4 == 4
# this due to the fact that just one "=" operates the same function as "<-":
a = 4
a <- 4
# if we want to test if two objects are different:
2 != 5
# example with outcome "TRUE"
a <- 3
b <- 2
a < b
# if we want to make R consider the alphabetical order, we can use brackets:
"a" < "b"
