### different ways to change panel settings and appearance

### Data types:

## logical values (T or F):
# TRUE (or T) is a value with no quotes:
TRUE
T
# FALSE (or F) is a value with no quotes
FALSE
F
# we shouldn't try to ovverride T and F with other variables, otherwise we won't have them anymore
# if we use the "typeof" function on T or F, it says "logical":
typeof(T)

## integer numbers (with no decimal numbers after comma)
# to specify that you want to consider a number as an integer number:
1L
# and then we can use this function to understand the nature of the element, and it says "integer":
typeof(1L)

## numerical values:
# every real number
# in our course, "numeric" means "double", that means that the number has both a part before comma and the other part after comma:
typeof(1)
# instead, if we write a number like this one:
0.00005
# the result "5e-05" means 5 * 10 ^ (-5)

## characters:
# this category comprehends words:
"hello"
"a"
"what have you been dreaming recently?"
typeof("what have you been dreaming recently?")
# however, if you put a number between quotes, it becomes a character:
typeof("1")
typeof("Via Irnerio 42")
# to see information about the function "typeof":
?typeof


### not let's do this:
print("Hello World")
# create a variable
first_world <- "Bellis"
# create another one (with parenthesis, to make R report it instantly:
(second_world <- "perennis")
# and then paste them together:
paste(first_world, second_world)
# now let's assign to our product a new name:
species_name <- paste(first_world, second_world)
# to paste another element after the first two ones:
paste(species_name, "L.")
# to give a new name to this variable:
full_name <- paste(species_name, "L.")
full_name


### if we type:
"hello'
# the "+" symbol says that R is expecting us to give it some more code
# in this case, the solution is to close the quotes:
"


### actually there exist two other types of data on R
# complex numbers:
5i  # the "i", in reality, is different 
# and raw values


### Packages:
# vegan started as a package for vegetation ecology, but then it became one of the major packages of R
# we can install packages thanks to the option "Install packages" (used for the "vegan" package) or, alternatively, using the function:
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
# important! the project must be reproducible, so all the commands have to be in a logical order
# we can retrieve packages using the "library" function:
library(vegan)
# usually, quotes are not used when using this function

# we can specify the exact package from which we want to pick and use a function:
dplyr::select(function name)
raster::select(function name)

# don't deselect a package in the package list, otherwise the code won't be reproducible


### Syntax errors:
# happen when you write something that's not supposed to be written
# for example, letters:
greet <- "hello"
greets
# or also, commas, that are essential to separate arguments:
paste(first_world second_world)
paste(first_world,. second_world)
# or also, spaces:
greet < - "hello"
# or, finally, parenthesis, to close functions:
print("hello world"
# in this last case, the "+" will appear, and we'll just have to close it with ")"

# by the way, also other types of parenthesis (square, curly) are available
