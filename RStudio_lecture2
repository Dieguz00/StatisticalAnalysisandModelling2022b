# different ways to change panel settings and appearance

### data types:

## logical values (T or F):
# TRUE (or T) is a value with no quotes:
TRUE
T
# FALSE (or F) is a value with no quotes
FALSE
F
# we shouldn't try to ovverride T and F with other variables, otherwise we won't have them anymore

## integer numbers (with no decimal numbers after comma)
# to specify that you want to consider a number as an integer number:
1L
# and then we can use this function to understand the nature of the element:
typeof(1L)
# if we use the same function in these other cases, R says respectively "double" and "logical":
typeof(1)
typeof(T)
# in our course, "numeric" means "double", that means that the number has both a part before comma and the other part after comma

## numerical values

## characters:
# this category comprehends words:
"hello"
"a"
"what have you been dreaming recently?"
typeof("what have you been dreaming recently?")
# however, if you put a number between quotes, it becomes a character:
typeof("1")
typeof("Via Irnerio 42")
# to see information about the function "typeof":
?typeof


# not let's do this:
print("Hello World")
# create a variable
first_world <- "Bellis"
# create another one (with parenthesis, to make R report it instantly:
(second_world <- "perennis")
# and then paste them together:
paste(first_world, second_world)
# now let's assign to our product a new name:
species_name <- paste(first_world, second_world)
# to paste another element after the first two ones:
paste(species_name, "L.")
# to give a new name to this variable:
full_name <- paste(species_name, "L.")
full_name
