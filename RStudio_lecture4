## Indexing (last part)
# let's create a vector:
my_integer <- 6:10
# let's see its length:
length(my_integer)
# and let's apply a name to its length:
integer_length <- length(my_integer)
# to extract the last element from a vector:
my_integer[integer_length]
# to extract the third last element from a vector:
my_integer[(integer_length - 2):integer_length]


### Modifying vectors
## combining indexing and assessing allows to modify vectors
# let's create a vector with a wrong variable:
work_days <- c("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "sunday")
work_days
# if we want to modify a certain element, we should assign to that element a new value:
work_days[5] <- "friday"
work_days
# to modify more than one element:
scores <- c("good", "good", "n.c.", "n.c.", "excellent")
scores[3:4] <- "insufficient"
scores
# otherwise, we can also use the logical values to access and modify our vector, by choosing the elements to modify with "TRUE":
scores <- c("good", "good", "n.c.", "n.c.", "excellent")
scores_to_fix <- c(F, F, T, T, F)
scores[scores_to_fix]
scores[scores_to_fix] <- "insufficient"
scores

# to add elements to a certain vector:
my_integer <- 1:5
c(my_integer, 6:10)
my_integer <- c(my_integer, 6:10)
my_integer
# or, otherwise, we could create another vector and then concatenate it to the previous one:
my_integer2 <- 11:15
c(my_integer, my_integer2)
my_integer <- c(my_integer, my_integer2)
my_integer

# to eliminate the first element from a certain vector:
my_integer <- my_integer[-1]
my_integer
# to remove a series of elements:
my_integer[-(3:7)]
# to remove elements that are not in sequence:
my_integer[-c(1,3,7)]
