## Indexing (last part)

# let's create a vector:
my_integer <- 6:10

# let's see its length:
length(my_integer)

# and let's apply a name to its length:
integer_length <- length(my_integer)

# to extract the last element from a vector:
my_integer[integer_length]

# to extract the third last element from a vector:
my_integer[(integer_length - 2):integer_length]



### Modifying vectors

## combining indexing and assessing allows to modify vectors

# let's create a vector with a wrong variable:
work_days <- c("monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "sunday")
work_days

# if we want to modify a certain element, we should assign to that element a new value:
work_days[5] <- "friday"
work_days

# to modify more than one element:
scores <- c("good", "good", "n.c.", "n.c.", "excellent")
scores[3:4] <- "insufficient"
scores

# otherwise, we can also use the logical values to access and modify our vector, by choosing the elements to modify with "TRUE":
scores <- c("good", "good", "n.c.", "n.c.", "excellent")
scores_to_fix <- c(F, F, T, T, F)
scores[scores_to_fix]
scores[scores_to_fix] <- "insufficient"
scores

# to add elements to a certain vector:
my_integer <- 1:5
c(my_integer, 6:10)
my_integer <- c(my_integer, 6:10)
my_integer

# or, otherwise, we could create another vector and then concatenate it to the previous one:
my_integer2 <- 11:15
c(my_integer, my_integer2)
my_integer <- c(my_integer, my_integer2)
my_integer

# to eliminate the first element from a certain vector:
my_integer <- my_integer[-1]
my_integer

# to remove a series of elements:
my_integer[-(3:7)]

# to remove elements that are not in sequence:
my_integer[-c(1,3,7)]


## Operations with vectors

# let's create two vectors:
vec1 <- 0:2
vec2 <- 3:5

# then, let's sum them:
vec1+vec2

# if we take a look to the vectors, we understand that the result is given by the sum of their element, in order:
vec1
vec2

# let's do the other operations, for which the same process applies:
vec1-vec2
vec1/vec2
vec1*5

# if we try to make operations with vectors of different length, the shorter vector is repeated cyclically until the longer one is completed:
vec3 <- 1:2
vec1
vec1+vec3


## Namying vectors

# the elements of a vector can be named,specifying, for each name, its value:
c("Rosaceae"=45L, "Fabaceae"=38L, "Poaceae"=56L)
plant_diversity <- c("Rosaceae"=45L, "Fabaceae"=38L, "Poaceae"=56L)
plant_diversity

# we can also use names to extract a certain element:
plant_diversity["Rosaceae"]

# to extract more elements, create a vector of names:
plant_diversity[c("Rosaceae", "Poaceae")]

# to extract just the names inside a vector (thus creating a character vector):
names(plant_diversity)

# to change the names of the elements of a vector:
names(plant_diversity)[2] <- "leguminosae"
plant_diversity

# to eliminate the names of the elements of a vector:
names(plant_diversity) <- NULL
plant_diversity





### Preview of the next lecture

## Making vectors with different types of elements (type coertion)

# we can create vectors also with different types of elements:
c("hello", 3)
c(FALSE, 3L)
c(TRUE, 3.14)
c(TRUE, "hello")
c("hello", 3L)

# in this case, character + numerical = charac, numerical + integer = numer, logical + character = charac, logical + numerical = numer, logical + integer = integ

# conseqequently, the priority order is: character, numerical, integer, logical


## Transforming vettor types

# to transform a logical vector in a vector of another type:
c(TRUE, FALSE)
as.integer(c(TRUE, FALSE))
as.character(c(T,F))

# moreover:
class(as.double(c(TRUE, FALSE)))

# if you transform, instead, a numerical in a logical, all 0s become FALSE, while all other numbers become TRUE:
as.logical(c(0,1,2))

# we can't transform characters into logical, except for "TRUE" and "FALSE":
as.logical(c("TRUE", "FALSE"))
as.logical(c("1", "hello", "3.14", "TRUE"))

# we can't transform characters into numerical, except for numbers themselves:
as.numeric(c("1", "hello", "3.14"))

# the same goes for characters into integer:
as.integer(c("1", "hello", "3.14"))


## Testing the type of a vector

# let's ask R the type of many vectors:
is.logical(c(TRUE, FALSE))
is.integer(c("hello", "unicorns"))
is.double(c(3.14, 2))
is.numeric(c(3.1, 2L))
is.character(c("hello", "good morning"))

# remember to preferentially use "double" instead of "numeric", as the second one could be misleading:
is.double(c(3L,2L))
is.numeric(c(3L,2L))
